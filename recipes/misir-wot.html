    <h4>Let's make your new favorite red lentil dish!</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee</li>
        <li>1 cup onion, chopped fine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1.5-2 tablespoons berbere seasoning</li>
        <li>1 cup red lentils, rinsed 2-3 times</li>
        <li>2.5 cups water</li>
        <li>lime juice, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a heavy bottom sauce pot or dutch oven. Add butter or ghee, along with chopped onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until onions soften.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and ginger and sauté another minute.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste, salt and Berbere seasoning / spice mix. Stir well. Add rinsed and drained lentils, 3 cups water and stir.</li>
        <li>Bring it to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, cover the pot and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the lentils cook through and reach a creamy consistency. Be sure to stir every few minutes or so. If the stew seems too thick, add ½ - 1 cup water (or as needed) and stir well till the water gets absorbed and lentils reach a creamy consistency. Check for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Finish the dish with a light squeeze of lime juice. Serve with the traditional sourdough flatbread, injera. Enjoy!</li>
