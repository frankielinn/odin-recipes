    <ol>
        <li>In a pot, add the eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, parsley, oil, spices, and water. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, for 10-25 minutes. Stir continuously, allowing the eggplant and tomatoes to mesh together into a dip consistency.</li>
        <li>Once softened, use a wooden spoon to mash the contents of the pan into a dip consistency.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste and lemon juice. Stir and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Simmer, uncovered, for another 10 minutes. The dip is ready to be served when it can coat the wooden spoon.</li>
