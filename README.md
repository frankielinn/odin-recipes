#odin-recipes
This is my take on the first project in The Odin Project
Foundations course: building a simple recipe website using
basic HTML. I will be utilizing elements and tags, writing
my own boilerplate from scratch, inserting text and
formatting lists, and including links and images. I will
then be commiting it to GitHub as my first full project.
